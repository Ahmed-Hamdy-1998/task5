- To store a floating-point number, 4-byte(32 bit) memory will be allocated in computer.

	1 bit for sign

	8 bit for exponent part

	23 bit for significant part


-  Integers
	 Integers are commonly stored using a word of memory, which is 4 bytes or 32 bits, 
	so integers from 0 up to 4,294,967,295 (232 - 1) can be stored. 
	Below are the integers 1 to 5 stored as four-byte values (each row represents one integer).
